# About

Hey ðŸ‘‹&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm Sourabh!

Currently building [Socials](https://socials.so) & work as a Spreadsheet Builder at [Rows](https://rows.com). If you're here to explore more about **Google Apps Script**, you may want to check out my dedicated space for that over at [script.gs](https://script.gs).

## The site

In case you're wondering how I came about building this gorgeous looking site â€” well, its the [Minimalist theme](https://www.bodunhu.com/minimalist/) powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) that I _borrowed_ from [Bodun Hu](https://www.bodunhu.com/), managed with GitHub and hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## Note

This space is still a work in progress, but do keep a lookout while I chronicle my ramblings.
