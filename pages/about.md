<h1>About</h1>

Hey 👋&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm Sourabh — your typical Spreadsheet nerd 🤓

I work at [Rows](https://rows.com/product) as a **Solutions Architect** and in my free time, explore ways to connect different tools, learn about a new technologies or just built stuff that no one ends-up using anyway (ex: my obsession with **Puppeteer** led me to build & sunset [socials.so](https://socials.so/) 🤦🏽‍♀️).

If you're here to explore more about **Google Apps Script**, you may want to check out my dedicated space for that over at [script.gs](https://script.gs).

## The site

In case you're wondering how I came about building this gorgeous looking site — well, its the [Minimalist theme](https://www.bodunhu.com/minimalist/) powered by **Jekyll** that I _borrowed_ from [Bodun Hu](https://twitter.com/BodunHu), managed with GitHub and hosted on **Vercel**.
